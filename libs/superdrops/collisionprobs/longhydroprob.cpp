 * functionality for probability of collision-coalescence
 * event between two (real) droplets using the
 * hydrodynamic (i.e. gravitational) kernel
 * according to Simmel et al. 2002's formulation
 * of Long's Hydrodynamic Kernel. Probability
 * calculations are contained in structures
 * that satisfy the requirements of the
 * PairProbability concept (see collisions.hpp)
